- Work on creating process instances with branches, loops and subprocesses

- left over: 
  - make sure testing is more extensive and covers everything.. 
    - current tests  don't have all of the tests they should have
    - gateways
    - end events: terminate, etc. 
      -> "event bus" mechanism necessary to communicate
  - condition expressios
    - in particular that the condition expressions, of all sorts,
      can be parsed and added to the rep. 
    - decide what to do with: 
      - xpath
      - tFormalExpression
      - bpmn2: prefix
      - .. etc. 

engine: 
  while( running ) { 
    candyString[i].execute(context) { 
      if( terminate ) { 
         // modify context to reflect that
      }

      if( context.terminate )  {
        // stop, signal stops
      }

looked into vert.x event bus
- read async javascript for info on single-threaded/browser/worker model

  - compileInstance() doesn't insert the closures yet? 
    - just does the graph compilation
    - need to do candy string compilation
