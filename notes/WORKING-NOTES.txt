- working on and running the processes!
! Minimal process, to start with, and then extend
  + convert the graph representation to a candy string
    + array elements with run(context) functions!


- left over: 
  - clean up tests (equal, notEqual instead of ok, etc. )
  - make sure testing is more extensive and covers everything.. 
    - current tests  don't have all of the tests they should have
    - gateways
    - end events: terminate, etc. 
      -> "event bus" mechanism necessary to communicate

engine: 
  while( running ) { 
    candyString[i].execute(context) { 
      if( terminate ) { 
         // modify context to reflect that
      }

      if( context.terminate )  {
        // stop, signal stops
      }

looked into vert.x event bus
- read async javascript for info on single-threaded/browser/worker model

  - compileInstance() doesn't insert the closures yet? 
    - just does the graph compilation
    - need to do candy string compilation

- Still todo: 
  . in particular that the condition expressions, of all sorts,
    can be parsed and added to the rep. 
  . decide what to do with: 
    - xpath
    - tFormalExpression
    - bpmn2: prefix
    - .. etc.
