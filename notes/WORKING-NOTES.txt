- was working on compiler. parsing. 
  + handleExpression goes into an endless loop if we change a
      var numChildren = exprNode.childNodes.length-1; 
    to
      var numChildren = exprNode.childNodes.length; 

 Fix this!

- and then continue working on getting all the representation tests to work
  . in particular that the condition expressions -- of all sorts -- can be
    parsed and added to the rep. 
  . decide what to do with: 
    - xpath
    - tFormalExpression
    - bpmn2: prefix
    - .. etc.
